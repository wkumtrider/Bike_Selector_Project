# Bike Selector Project
This project allows a user to enter a bike manufacturer and return a list of bikes offered by that manufacturer.

This is my project for Code Louisville Software Development course.

This is a menu based console application.

# Features of This Project
1. Implement a console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.  
2. Create 3 or more unit tests for the application (XUnit)
