# Bike Selector Project
This project allows a user to enter a bike manufacturer and return a list of bikes offered by that manufacturer.  The user will select a specific biek manufacturer and the program will return the model(s) that meet the requirements.  The user can also add a new bike to the database.

This is my project for Code Louisville Software Development course.

This is a menu based console application.

# Features of This Project
1. Implement a console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.  
2. Read from a JSON file and use the data in the project.
3. Use a LINQ query to return specific data from the JSON file.
